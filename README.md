# UPThreads

An application that helps students communicate between themselves. The appp provides a forum for each specific subject where students can ask questions, receive help from other students or help others by answering questions.
  
The app is mainly used by students, with the additional admins that have to approve a student's request to join.
  
After logging in, the user can interact with forums where they have access based on their faculty and year. They can post questions to a specific forum or answer other students' questions. The user can click on a question and a more detailed version of it togheter with the description and the already given answers will appear.
  
Every question has a description, maybe some attached files to it.
